      This space exists to collect ideas, experiments, and work that refuses to stay
      inside notebooks and unfinished folders.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Curiosity-driven, detail-obsessed, and constantly switching between building,
      breaking, and rebuilding. Interested in systems, stories, and things that sit
      awkwardly between logic and emotion.

        <h3>Experiments</h3>
        <p>
          Small projects focused on learning, speed, and testing ideas without
          over-polishing them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Longer Builds</h3>
        <p>
          Slower, more deliberate work where structure, failure, and iteration matter
          more than results.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Collaborations</h3>
        <p>
          Shared projects shaped by conflicting opinions, late revisions, and unexpected
          outcomes.

  <section id="notes">
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Thoughts that are not finished enough to be essays, but too sharp to be ignored.
      Collected here before they disappear.

  <section id="contact">
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      Reach out through platforms where ideas matter more than bios and conversations
      don’t start with formalities.
